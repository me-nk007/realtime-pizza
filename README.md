# realtime-pizza
This is a project in which i have been working on where a user can order his favorite pizza and track the process of it. I will be adding more functionality to it soon.
Here, i am using Express server, node.js, ejs template, scss and laravel mix to compile my scss.

We are using passport.js for authentication
